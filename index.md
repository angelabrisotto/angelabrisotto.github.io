## _writer, translator, and actress_ 


**ABOUT ME**

My name is Angela Brisotto and I am a writer, translator, and actress from and based in Italy. I spent the last few years studying foreign languages while I was also trained in the analysis of literary texts with a special focus on theater. Inspired by my work for the _Brooklyn Rail_, a New York-based journal on art and culture, I set out to interview people working in the arts. My creative research interests reside in theater, literature, and the exploration of boundaries between the written, visual, and performative dimensions of the arts. I am a contributor to _The Brooklyn Rail_.
