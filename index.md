## Writing to support the arts and the love for culture

### *Scrivo per sostenere le arti e l’amore per la cultura*
      
  
[**MADDALENA GRANZIERA with Angela Brisotto, Victoria Stephanie Uzumyemezoglu, Sara Antoniolli, and Olga Lepri**](https://brooklynrail.org/2020/07/art/MADDALENA-GRANZIERA-with-Angela-Brisotto-Victoria-Stephanie-Uzumyemezoglu-Sara-Antoniolli-and-Olga-Lepri), _The Brooklyn Rail_, Jul-Aug 20 Issue, 2020.  

   > "Explorative hikes are creatively and spiritually meaningful to the Veneto region-based emergent artist, whose painting and photographic artwork is imbued with surreal geographic references echoing cosmic allusions, her imagination, and a planet Earth untouched by human presence."

      
  
[**BARBARA DE VIVI with Angela Brisotto, Victoria Stephanie Uzumyemezoglu, Sara Antoniolli, and Olga Lepri**](https://brooklynrail.org/2019/12/art/BARBARA-DE-VIVI-with-Angela-Brisotto-Victoria-Stephanie-Uzumyemezoglu-Sara-Antoniolli-Olga-Lepri), _The Brooklyn Rail_, Dec 19-Jan 20 Issue, 2019.  

   > "It makes such a contrast to leave the comfort of the warm sun to explore the grotto-like space where De Vivi, a Venetian artist, colorfully layers mythology, ancient iconography, and contemporary imagery within her paintings."

   > "The economic crisis of 2007 and 2008 was a globally shocking experience. This year – 2018 – marks a ten-year timespan since the financial collapse. Even though quite a long time has passed, puzzlement and confusion are still the feelings that many individuals share when trying to understand the crisis-related events."
